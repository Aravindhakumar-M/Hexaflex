# 5 DOF Robotic Arm Control

This repository provides two distinct methods for controlling a versatile 5 Degrees of Freedom (DOF) robotic arm, all powered by an Arduino microcontroller. Choose your preferred method:

## 1. Bluetooth-Controlled (Mobile App)

- The 'Bluetooth-Controlled' method offers an easy-to-use mobile application for remote control of the robotic arm.
- Utilize the custom-built mobile app, which features sliders to precisely adjust each joint's position.
- Experience intuitive control from the palm of your hand, making this method perfect for beginners and quick demonstrations.

## 2. ROS-Controlled (Robot Operating System)

- The 'ROS-Controlled' method is ideal for integration within complex robotic systems.
- Leverage the power of the Robot Operating System (ROS) to orchestrate advanced control and coordination of the robotic arm.
- This method is favored by researchers, developers, and robotic enthusiasts seeking to implement the arm within larger projects.

Both methods demonstrate the flexibility and adaptability of the 5 DOF robotic arm, offering solutions for a wide range of applications. Whichever method you choose, the underlying Arduino microcontroller ensures reliable and precise control.

## How to Get Started

For specific instructions on how to set up and utilize each method, please refer to the individual folders:
